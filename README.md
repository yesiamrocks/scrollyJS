# ‚ú® ScrollyJS

**ScrollyJS** is a lightweight, zero-dependency JavaScript library for triggering CSS animations when elements enter the viewport ‚Äî on scroll, hover, click, or custom triggers.

- üéØ Zero config for default scroll-based animation
- ‚öôÔ∏è Custom triggers like `mouseenter`, `click`, and more
- üî¨ Built with IntersectionObserver
- ü™∂ Lightweight and fast
- üîß Easily extendable

You can create a rich and **storytelling animated web pages** with up and down scrolling üëã
Visitors can feel the page with scrolling and it has a really minimal learning curve.

`Scrolly.js` plugin is proudly created and maintained by [cssanimation.io](http://cssanimation.io/) team, that a web based open source animation library by a team of **passionate web animation lover**.

We developed the most easier way to work with scroll animation, Just use `data-scrolly-top` and `data-scrolly-down` attribute to quickly build powerful templates of your own.

## üì¶ Installation

### Using npm

```bash
npm install scrollyjs
```

```js
import Scrolly from "scrollyjs";
Scrolly.init();
```

### Using CDN

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/scrollyjs/dist/scrolly.min.js"></script>
<script>
  Scrolly.init();
</script>
```

## Animation Classes

**ScrollyJS** uses pre-built animation classes from **[{css}animation](https://github.com/yesiamrocks/cssanimation)**. You can either include them via CDN or install them as part of your project.

‚ûï Add cssanimation
Option 1: Use CDN (Recommended for quick use)

```html
<link
  href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@hellouxpavel/cssanimation@latest/dist/cssanimation.min.css"
  rel="stylesheet" />
```

Option 2: Install via npm

```bash
npm i @hellouxpavel/cssanimation
```

Then import it:

```js
import "@hellouxpavel/cssanimation";
```

## Getting Started

### Define DOWN Animation

Once you've done that, define animation class name in `data-scrolly-down` attribute like the example below to the element **that you want to animate when the page scroll to DOWN**. here we are using `blurInTop`.

```html
<div data-scrolly-down="blurInTop">it's easy to do</div>
```

### Define TOP Animation

Like the DOWN animation, to animate element **while scrollig to TOP**, just use `data-scrolly-top` attribute and add whatever animation you want. We used `blurInBottom` for example.

```html
<div data-scrolly-top="blurInBottom">it's easy to do</div>
```

### Use Both DOWN and TOP Animation

You can also trigger an animation effect in any given element from both **DOWN & TOP**, means it will animate on both scrolling **DOWN & TOP**. See the example below-

```html
<div data-scrolly-top="blurInBottom" data-scrolly-down="blurInTop">
  it's easy to do
</div>
```

### Use Animation on Character

Yes!! you can now animate each character of any sentences while you scroll. Add `data-scrolly-characters="sequential"` for sequential animation of the characters or `data-scrolly-characters="random"` if you want it to animate it in random order.... **isn't it exciting !!**

```html
<h1
  data-scrolly-characters="sequentially"
  data-scrolly-down="leSpinInRight"
  data-scrolly-top="leSpinInLeft">
  I am Awesome. I can animate every characters in a sentence
</h1>

<h1
  data-scrolly-characters="randomly"
  data-scrolly-down="leSpinInRight"
  data-scrolly-top="leSpinInLeft">
  I am Awesome. I can animate every characters in a sentence
</h1>
```

### Add Delay in Character Animation

You can add dealy on character animation by adding `data-scrolly-characters="delay:100"` attribute.

```html
<h1
  data-scrolly-characters="sequentially"
  data-scrolly-characters="delay:100"
  data-scrolly-down="leSpinInRight"
  data-scrolly-top="leSpinInLeft">
  I am Awesome. I can animate every characters in a sentence
</h1>

<h1
  data-scrolly-characters="randomly"
  data-scrolly-characters="delay:100"
  data-scrolly-down="leSpinInRight"
  data-scrolly-top="leSpinInLeft">
  I am Awesome. I can animate every characters in a sentence
</h1>
```

### Use Animation Duration

Default animation duration is `1s` but you can always define your custom duration by adding `duration:[number]s` attribute.

```html
<div data-scrolly-down="blurInTop, duration:2s">it's easy to do</div>
```

### Add Delay

By adding the attribute `delay:[number]s` you can set a delay time to start of an animation.

```html
<div data-scrolly-down="blurInTop, delay:2s">I am start after 2s</div>
```

### Infinite or Specify The Number of Animation

The `iteration-count` specifies the number of times an animation should be played. Use `iteration-count: 3` if you want to animate 3 times or use `iteration-count:infinite` which should play the animation with no limit.

```html
<div data-scrolly-down="blurInTop, iteration-count:3">I am animate 3 times</div>

<div data-scrolly-down="blurInTop, iteration-count:infinite">
  I am animate unlimited times
</div>
```

### Animation Direction

You can run the animation in reverse direction or alternate cycle **(forward, backward, then again forward)** using `direction` attribute.

```html
<div data-scrolly-down="blurInTop, direction:reverse">it's easy to do</div>

<div data-scrolly-top="moveFromRight, iteration-count:3, direction:alternate">
  it's easy to do
</div>
```

### Timing Function

You can add all CSS pre-defined speed curve `ease, ease-in, ease-out, linear` of an animation or define your own values with a `cubic-bezier` function by adding `timing-function` attribute.

```html
<div data-scrolly-down="blurInTop, timing-function:linear">it's easy to do</div>

<div
  data-scrolly-down="blurInTop, timing-function:cubic-bezier(.17,.67,.83,.67)">
  it's easy to do
</div>
```

### Define Top Offset Value

Set the top animation starting point after it appears on the browser window `data-scrolly-offset-top="300px"`.

```html
<div data-scrolly-down="blurInTop" data-scrolly-offset-top="300px">
  it's easy to do
</div>
```

### Define Bottom Offset Value

Like the top offset the `data-scrolly-offset-bottom="500px"` attribute can be used to set the bottom starting point of the animation.

```html
<div data-scrolly-down="blurInBottom" data-scrolly-offset-bottom="500px">
  it's easy to do
</div>
```

### On Click Animtion

Initiate the animation with on click event using by `data-scrolly-click="fadeIn"`.

```html
<div data-scrolly-down="blurInBottom" data-scrolly-click="fadeIn">
  I am animate when you click me. Please click
</div>
```

### Mouse Over Animtion

For mouse over animation add the `data-scrolly-mouseover="zoomIn"` attribute

```html
<div data-scrolly-down="blurInBottom" data-scrolly-mouseover="zoomIn">
  I am animate when you hover me
</div>
```

### Mouse Out Animtion

Add `data-scrolly-mouseout="fadeInLeft"` attribute to animate on mouse out event.

```html
<div data-scrolly-down="blurInBottom" data-scrolly-mouseout="fadeInLeft">
  I am animate when you click me
</div>
```

### Targeted Object Animate When You Click

Targeted Object Animate When You Click: If you want to animate a content by clicking by another one, follow this simple instruction.

```html
<input
  type="button"
  value="Hit me to Animate targetd object"
  data-srolly-selector="targetElement" />

<div
  data-scrolly-selector="targetElement"
  data-scrolly-target-click="pushReleaseFromBottom">
  I am animate your target object when you click me
</div>
```

### Targeted Object Animate When You Mouse Over

Animate any content while hovering mouse on another one.

```html
<input
  type="button"
  value="Hit me to Animate targetd object"
  data-srolly-selector="targetElement" />

<div
  data-scrolly-selector="targetElement"
  data-scrolly-target-click="flipYZoomIn">
  I am animate your target object when you hover me
</div>
```

### Targeted Object Animate When You Mouse Out

Unlike those two follow the instruction below to animate targeted contents while doing mouse out on another one.

```html
<input
  type="button"
  value="Hit me to Animate targetd object"
  data-srolly-selector="targetElement" />

<div
  data-scrolly-selector="targetElement"
  data-scrolly-target-click="rotateInLeft">
  I am animate your target object when you mouse out from me
</div>

<script type="text/javascript" src="scrolly/scrolly.js"></script>
<script>
  window.onload = function () {
    scrolly();
  };
</script>
```
